# Gmail Setup Guide for TwitterAI Pro

## Issue: Email Authentication Failed (Error 535-5.7.8)

You're seeing this error because Gmail requires special configuration to send emails from applications.

## Solution: Use Gmail App Passwords

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication

1. Go to your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Click on "Security" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Signing in to Google," click "2-Step Verification"
4. Follow the prompts to set up 2FA (you'll need your phone)

### Step 2: Generate an App Password

1. Stay in the "Security" section of your Google Account
2. Scroll down to "2-Step Verification" and click it
3. Scroll down to "App passwords" (you may need to sign in again)
4. Under "Select app," choose "Mail"
5. Under "Select device," choose "Other (Custom name)" and type "TwitterAI Pro"
6. Click "Generate"
7. Copy the 16-character code that appears (without spaces)

### Step 3: Update Your Environment Variables

1. Open your `.env` file in the `backend` folder
2. Replace the `EMAIL_PASS` value with your new App Password
3. **Important**: Remove any spaces from the App Password

Example:
```env
EMAIL_USER=mahetadeepak04@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=xtkscutvfftaqthq  # Your 16-character App Password without spaces
```

### Step 4: Restart Your Server

1. Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)
2. Start it again with `npm start` or `npm run dev`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Username and Password not accepted"

**Solution**: 
- Generate a NEW App Password (old ones may be revoked)
- Ensure there are NO spaces in the App Password
- Double-check that you're using your Gmail address as `EMAIL_USER`

### Issue: App Password field is missing

**Solution**: 
- Make sure 2-Factor Authentication is fully enabled
- Try using a different browser
