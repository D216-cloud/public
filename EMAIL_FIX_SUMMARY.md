# Email Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was failing to send verification emails with the error:
```
535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted
```

This is a common Gmail SMTP authentication error that occurs when:

### 4. Created Test Scripts
- `testEmail.js`: Script to test email configuration and provide detailed feedback
- Added validation for common mistakes (spaces in App Password, incorrect length)

### 5. Updated All Relevant Files
- `backend/utils/sendMail.js`: Enhanced error handling for email sending
- `backend/services/twitterService.js`: Better error messages for OTP email failures
- `backend/controllers/twitterController.js`: User-friendly error messages for frontend

   EMAIL_PASS=your_16_character_app_password  # No spaces
   ```

3. **Restart Your Server**:
