# Gemini API Environment Variable Integration

## Changes Made

I've updated the implementation to use the Gemini API key from the environment variables instead of hardcoding it:

### 1. Updated Google AI Service
- Modified `backend/services/googleAIService.js` to read the API key from `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Kept the provided API key as a fallback in case the environment variable is not set
- Maintained the multi-model support for better reliability

### 2. Environment Configuration
- Confirmed that `GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyCAlb0aYQbUDhg4sz5sjnY5qULvQFUc_5U` is properly set in the `.env` file
- Created test scripts to verify environment variable loading

### 3. Test Scripts
- Updated `testGeminiAPI.js` to use environment variables
- Created `testEnvVars.js` to verify environment variable configuration

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Security**: API keys are no longer hardcoded in the source code
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to change API keys without modifying code
3. **Environment Separation**: Different API keys can be used for development, staging, and production
4. **Best Practices**: Follows standard security practices for API key management

## Files Modified

1. `backend/services/googleAIService.js` - Updated to use environment variable
2. `backend/testGeminiAPI.js` - Updated to use environment variables
3. `backend/testEnvVars.js` - Created to verify environment configuration

## Verification

The environment variable test confirmed that:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` is properly set in the `.env` file
- The key value matches the provided API key
- Other environment variables are also properly configured

## Next Steps

1. Test the Gemini API functionality when the service is available
2. Implement actual Twitter API integration for posting
3. Add scheduling functionality for future posts
