# Twitter Connection Error Fix

## Problem Identified
The error you're seeing:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
SettingsPage.tsx:252 Error connecting Twitter: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```

This error occurs because:
1. The frontend is trying to call a non-existent API endpoint `/api/twitter/connect`
2. When the endpoint doesn't exist, the server returns a 404 HTML error page
3. The frontend tries to parse this HTML as JSON, causing the "Unexpected token '<'" error

## Root Cause
In `SettingsPage.tsx` line 252, the code was calling:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/twitter/connect`, {
```

But the correct endpoint for initiating Twitter OAuth is `/api/twitter/auth`, not `/api/twitter/connect`.

## Fix Implemented
I've updated the `SettingsPage.tsx` file to use the correct endpoint:

```javascript
// Use the correct endpoint for Twitter OAuth flow
const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/twitter/auth`, {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  }
})
```

## Additional Issues to Check

### 1. Twitter API Credentials
Your `.env` file still contains placeholder values:
```
TWITTER_CLIENT_ID=your_twitter_client_id_here
TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET=your_twitter_client_secret_here
```

You need to replace these with actual Twitter API credentials from the Twitter Developer Portal.

### 2. Server Status
Make sure your backend server is running on port 5000:
- Run `node server.js` in the `backend` directory
- Check that you can access `http://localhost:5000` in your browser

### 3. Frontend Configuration
Verify that your frontend is correctly configured to communicate with the backend:
- Check that `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000` in your `.env` file
- Make sure the frontend is running on a different port (like 8080)

## How to Test the Fix

1. Make sure both frontend and backend servers are running
2. Navigate to the Settings page in your application
3. Try to connect your Twitter account
4. You should now be redirected to Twitter for OAuth authentication

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` - Fixed the incorrect API endpoint call

## Next Steps
1. Get actual Twitter API credentials and update your `.env` file
2. Test the Twitter connection flow
3. Complete the OAuth verification process
